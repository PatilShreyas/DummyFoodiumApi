      "body": "We are on a parking lot for campers in the Northern part of Germany. I was supposed to go shooting in the morning, but it is raining like crazy, so instead we have an indoor working day. I kind of like these days, sitting together in a small space, concentrating on work, because as soon as we finish, we can hang out. My mom told me to write down each day in a journal, because with years passing I will start to forget. `I did the same thing 10 years ago, when I was travelling in Asia with Tomasz, for a year I wrote each day, everything that has happened. Sometimes I go back to these journals (I wrote 3) and I read them like books, because I literally don’t remember that some of these things happened to me. A crazy experience. Thankfully, I have this blog and I can write as much as I want. So… I will write about yesterday. We woke up early in a morning to a beautiful sun. I was working and observing the sun rays dancing on a table. We parked next to Szczecińska Lagoon and there were many birds just meters away from us. It was one of these mornings when you love van life the most. We’ve decided to have breakfast outside, which maybe wasn’t the best idea due to a low temperature, but we did enjoy it anyway. We were sitting on the edge of marina, frying eggs and cutting veggies. We had some strong coffee and I made a breakfast wrap, which turned out beautifully. Just a few simple ingredients – eggs, onion, capsicum and avocado. You wrap it, heat it in a pan and it tastes like heaven. You may think it was because of the cold weather, but we fried some more in a van and it tasted as good as outside. Van kitchen is simple, mostly because there is no space for complicated. But this is also how breakfast should be – easy and delicious.",
